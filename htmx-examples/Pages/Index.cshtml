                            Interactivity with HTMX: An Overview of the ASP.NET Core Demos</h3>
                        <p>In the world of modern web development, there&#39;s often a perceived requirement to use
                            heavy JavaScript frameworks to achieve a smooth, reactive user experience. However, <a
                                href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> offers a powerful alternative by allowing you to
                            access modern browser features directly from HTML, without sacrificing the simplicity of
                            server-side rendering with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.</p>
                        <p>This project serves as a comprehensive workshop for understanding how HTMX can transform
                            traditional web applications. Below is an overview of the key demos included in this
                            collection and the reasoning behind each pattern.</p>
                        <h4 id="what-is-htmx-">What is HTMX?</h4>
                        <p>HTMX is a library that allows you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server
                            Sent Events directly in HTML using attributes. It follows the &quot;Hypermedia as the Engine
                            of Application State&quot; (HATEOAS) principle, where the server returns HTML fragments
                            rather than JSON. This reduces complexity by keeping your state and logic on the server.</p>
                        <h4 id="why-htmx-with-asp-net-core-">Why HTMX with ASP.NET Core?</h4>
                        <p>ASP.NET Core Razor Pages is a natural fit for HTMX. Since HTMX expects HTML fragments, you
                            can use <strong>Partial Views</strong> and <strong>Named Page Handlers</strong> to return
                            exactly what the client needs, avoiding full page reloads and keeping your C# code clean and
                            centralized.</p>

                        <h5 id="1-data-interaction-patterns">1. Data Interaction Patterns</h5>
                        <p>These demos showcase how to handle common data-driven tasks with minimal overhead:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Active Search</strong>: Triggers a search request as the user types, updating
                                the results table in real-time.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Bulk Update</strong>: Demonstrates selecting multiple rows to perform a
                                collective action, like updating status or deleting.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Click To Edit / Edit Row</strong>: Implements inline editing patterns where a
                                row or a detail view toggles between &quot;view&quot; and &quot;edit&quot; modes without
                                a page refresh.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Delete Row</strong>: Shows how to remove data from the UI and server with a
                                simple AJAX request and smooth CSS transitions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 id="2-advanced-loading-techniques">2. Advanced Loading Techniques</h5>
                        <p>Improve perceived performance by loading only what is necessary:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lazy Loading</strong>: Defers the loading of heavy components (like charts)
                                until after the initial page shell is rendered.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Infinite Scroll &amp; Click To Load</strong>: Alternatives to traditional
                                pagination that provide a seamless &quot;feed-like&quot; experience for large datasets.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Progress Bar</strong>: Handles long-running server tasks by polling for status
                                updates and updating a visual progress indicator.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 id="3-enhanced-ui-components">3. Enhanced UI Components</h5>
                        <p>Bringing desktop-like interactivity to the browser:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Animations</strong>: Shows how to use CSS transitions with HTMX to create
                                smooth UI updates, such as fading out deleted elements or animating color changes.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Dialogs (Browser, UIKit, Custom)</strong>: Explore three ways to handle
                                modals—using native browser alerts, framework-specific components, or fully custom
                                HTML/CSS modals.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Tabs</strong>: Implements a tabbed interface where content is swapped
                                dynamically, reducing the initial payload.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Inline Validation</strong>: Provides immediate feedback on form fields (e.g.,
                                &quot;Email already exists&quot;) as the user moves between inputs.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Drag &amp; Drop Sortable</strong>: Integrates with libraries like SortableJS to
                                allow reordering of lists, with the new order saved back to the server.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong>: Demonstrates how to trigger HTMX actions using
                                global or context-sensitive key presses.
